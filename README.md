# Created a Web Application that displays the deals from multiple popular fast food restaurants in a specific area.
### For the Website, I used Typescript, React, and TailWind CSS.
### For retrieving the deals, I created a manual script using Javascript to retrieve the deals using Node.js and puppeteer.
- The deals are generated after running the script in the directory or the bash script in the deals.ts file. This file holds all the deals that were retrieved
from the script.
-- If deals were retrieved, the restaurant card will have a button 'View Deals' to display the deals retrieved.
-- If no deals were retrieved do to error or a restaurant's deal retrieval has not been implemented, it will show "Coming Soon".
